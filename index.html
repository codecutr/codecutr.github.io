SPARCS builds            on the success of the NSF S-STEM Tech Valley Scholars program and            focuses on recruiting and retaining computing majors in high school            and the first two years of college. The program includes a high            school dual enrollment program that introduces computer science            education to Capital District high schools that are currently not            offering it. The program improves computing recruitment by offering            high school students an opportunity to gain exposure to computing so            they might better assess their interest in computing as a college            major. The result is a larger and more qualified computing workforce            in New York State's Capital Region. </p>          <p> SPARCS recruits and nurtures new computing majors through            graduation, with an emphasis on recruiting and retention in high            school and the first two years of college. High school recruiting            focuses on using partnerships to institute an introductory computing            course at schools that do not have computing courses. College level            recruiting focuses on undeclared students in each of Siena's three            schools (Science, Business, and Liberal Arts). Recruitment also            extends to students struggling in their current major who have            demonstrated strong academic potential for computing and may not            have been afforded the opportunity to explore computing. Retention            efforts concentrate on expanding undergraduate internships,            incorporating classroom/lab assistants, and engaging students in            other activities designed to foster a sense of community. </p>          <p> The project is being assessed and evaluated by an external            consultant who has identified the following outcomes as a measure of            the effectiveness of the program: the effectiveness of campaigns to            recruit computing students into Siena, the impact of the SPARCS            program on students staying in computing at Siena, the quality of            student performance in courses and research projects, the number of            students from underrepresented groups, and the number of students            entering graduate school or the professional workforce after            graduation. </p>        </div>        <!-- column --> </div>      <!-- row -->      <!-- /.row -->      <!-- FOOTER -->      <footer>        <hr>        <p>Funding for this project was provided by the National Science          Foundation (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1432198">NSF
