            <h1>Early Internship Program</h1>
            The Early Internship Program involves six students that have
            completed the first year
            CS sequence an undergraduate internships as early as possible. In
            addition to sharpening and
            expanding their technical skills, an internship experience develops
            an awareness of how classroom
            concepts are converted into applications of value in today’s
            society. These type of opportunities, that
            allow students to experience real world problems and gain confidence
            in their ability to contribute in
            meaningful ways, are particularly helpful in recruiting and
            retaining women in CS. </div>
          <div class="table-responsive"><br>
            <p> Our partners in the IUSE SPARCS summer internship program
              include both external and internal (Siena) partners. In the
              summer, after their freshman
              year, six students are selected from the students who have
              completed the first-year CS sequence.
              They spend six weeks working on a real-world project for one of
              the internship partners. Siena CS faculty meet in advance with
              mentors from each organization to identify meaningful projects,
              keeping in mind that these students will be in the early stages of
              their CS education. The students
              meet regularly with their partner supervisor during the six-week
              period to discuss such
              things as project requirements, project management, technology
              platforms, evaluating tangibles, etc. For
              the external partner interns, a Siena CS faculty (the PI or a
              Co-PI on the grant) travel with the students to
              attend these meetings as needed to understand the details of the
              project. The students do the actual
              work in the CS department at Siena College where they can draw on
              the technical expertise and guidance
              of the Siena CS faculty. Because the students are reporting to an
              off-campus organization/supervisor,
              this additional involvement of CS faculty is useful for managing
              the smaller day-to-day issues and
              questions that arise due to the lack of CS maturity, having only
              completed the first-year sequence. For
              the internal (on Siena's campus) interns, the students work
              closely alongside a professional mentor who
              provides training, mentoring, and technical expertise. Regular
              lunches are organized for all the interns
              and Siena CS faculty. At these lunches, they share their
              internship experiences, successes, and
              challenges as well as discuss issues related to the workplace.</p>
            <p> At the time of the summer internship, the students have
              completed three computer science courses
              covering introductory programming (primarily in Java, some
              Python), general CS topics, and web design.
              Students may use a portion of their internship time reviewing
              books and tutorials to learn specialized
              software tools and applications needed for their internship
              projects. Examples of the types of projects the
              students may work on include: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Researching and experimenting with new technologies.</li>
              <li>Testing and evaluating software tools and applications.</li>
              <li>Designing and creating web sites.</li>
              <li>Prototyping user interfaces using tools like Flinto or Pop.</li>
              <li>Requirements gathering</li>
              <li>Writing programs to analyze data sets or massage data into
                proper format.</li>
              <li>Developing databases using Microsoft Access.</li>
              <li>Managing and maintaining computers and providing technical
                support to users.</li>
            </ul>
            <p> The students receive a summer stipend for the work, and
              non-local students are also be provided
              with an additional stipend to cover campus room and board.
              Students may choose to earn Siena credits
              for the internship, although normal summer tuition fees apply.</p>
