We work          closely with partnering high schools and cooperating math/technology          teachers to start a dual enrollment program that offers an          introductory computer science course for which their students can          receive Siena College credit. Few NYS schools have a teacher with the          formal CS background necessary to teach a rigorous, concepts-rich          college level CS course (as opposed to teaching utilitarian skills in          keyboarding and use of commercial software packages). Therefore, the          key focus of this component of our program is educating cooperating          teachers on the concepts and programming skills covered in Siena’s          context-based Introduction to Computer Science course (CSIS110). We          will do this through a two year program that pairs a college faculty          member with a cooperating teacher to team-teach the course, with the          goal of having the high school teacher gain the confidence needed to          teach the course on their own starting in the third year of the course          offering and beyond. We have connected this initiative to the <a href="EarlyAssistantship.html">early
            assistantship</a> retention initiative, by providing stipends to          Siena students who have completed the first-year CS sequence to work          alongside Siena faculty at the high schools as student teaching          assistants.          <div class="table-responsive"><br>          </div>          <div class="table-responsive">A slightly scaled-down version of this            program has been funded internally by Siena to continue beyond the            grant period.&nbsp; High school teachers will work directly with a            Siena Course Coordinator to assist them with teaching Siena's            Introduction to Computer Science Course at their high school.&nbsp;            The internal funding will allow us to help all partnering schools            long-term.&nbsp; Interested in being a partner high school?&nbsp;            Contact our High School Course Coordinator, <a href="https://www.siena.edu/faculty-and-staff/profile/matthews1">Prof.
