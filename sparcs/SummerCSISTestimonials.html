                student because there are a lot of people who would love

                I learned a lot about Computer Science that I never knew
                before. I think it was a great way to be introduced to
                CS and to see if we liked it, before committing to it."

          <div class="panel-body"> “Having always had an interest in
            modern computer technologies, I decided to take a gamble and
            see what the world of Computer Science and programming is
            all about. After taking CSIS 110, and CSIS 120, I was
            hooked. Programming is like being given a box full of tools
            and unlimited material to build whatever you could possibly
            desire to be spilled out onto a computer screen. By the end
            of CSIS 120 I was programming a java based emulator for the
            classic video game "Pac-Man", and that summer the Computer
            Science professors at Siena College were offering me a
            paying position on a Research Team for Artificial
            Intelligence programming. Finding my niche in the world of
            Computer Sciences has provided me not only with joy for the
            field I intend to make a career out of but also
            opportunities that I likely wouldn't have received anywhere
            else."<br>

              College Computer Science Major 2014 &nbsp;</span><br>
            <br>
            “This year I have taken both CSIS 110 &amp; CSIS120 and they
            are just great! The class has a logical feel to it compared
            to other non-CSIS classes. It is a nice change of pace, and
            the coursework is enjoyable. I wish I had tried CS classes
            sooner because I am now finishing my senior year at
            Siena.&nbsp; I have enjoyed the CS so much that I am
            currently looking for ways to continue my computer science
            education after graduation. In my bit of work experience, I
            found background knowledge in your major is assumed - you
            begin to add value when you offer something different. A
            Computer Science minor provides a great start to setting
            yourself apart.” <br>
