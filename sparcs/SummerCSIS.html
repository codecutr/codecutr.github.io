            <h1>2016 Summer CSIS Experience</h1>
            The summer CSIS experience will be run in Roger Bacon Hall on
            Siena's campus Monday-Friday August 29 - September 2 (moving in on
            Sunday August 28).&nbsp; There will be morning and afternoon
            sessions each day, as well as some evening sessions.&nbsp;&nbsp; If
            you will be living on campus for the Fall 2015 semester, you can
            simply move in to your regular dorm room a week early.&nbsp; If not,
            we will put you up in a dorm for the week.&nbsp; In either case,
            there is no cost to you for food or lodging.&nbsp; In addition, if
            you live locally and would rather not live in the dorms during the
            program, that is fine too.<br>
            <br>
            The goal of this program is to help you decide whether Computer
            Science is something you want to explore further (and if you do,
            we'll save a seat for you CSIS110 in the Fall or Spring).&nbsp; You
            are not committed to anything beyond this week, however, and there
            are no grades to worry about. <br>
            <br>
            So, what will we do during the week?&nbsp; A combination of hands-on
            activities and guest presentations.&nbsp; We will introduce 1-2
            topics per day, Afternoons will be spent exploring how these topics
            are applied in our labs. Here is a list of potential topics (this
            list may change):<br>
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li> Robotics</li>
              <li>Game Development</li>
              <li>Big Data</li>
              <li>Networks and Graphs</li>
              <li>Models of Computation</li>
              <li>Manipulating images and sounds</li>
              <li>Programming in Java</li>
              <li>Data sharing and transactions</li>
              <li>Information storage and compression </li>
              <li>Error detection</li>
              <li>Searching for information</li>
              <li>Encryption/decryption </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            In addition to the primary daily activities of learning about the
            field of Computer Science, we will also (mainly in the evening)
            offer faculty lectures, guest presentations about career
            opportunities, areas of research in computer science, and talks from
            our current advanced CS majors discussing their internships, career
            prospects, how to choose a major/minor, research work, etc. <br>

            Computer Science is an exciting field with many career opportunities
            for majors and enhanced career opportunities for minors:&nbsp; “<a target="_blank"
